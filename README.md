""" Space-Arena
  -This is my first game project and is still in development 
  -My goal with this sprint was to optimize the game, improve mechanics, as well as implement reuseability with the game objects.
  -Next sprint will focus on a polished menu system 
  -This version of the game is incomplete, the current game files have been uploaded to github for safety"""
